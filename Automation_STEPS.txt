From Fasta file to Analysis 

 

Download and extract Automation_tool_scripts recipitory 

 

The first step is to generate the initial replicas. Go to https://idpconformergenerator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html or follow the installation steps below: 

 

Go to Automation_tool_scripts /Idpconfgenerator_automation and install module here.  

git clone https://github.com/julie-forman-kay-lab/IDPConformerGenerator 

cd IDPConformerGenerator 

conda env create -f requirements.yml 

 

Copy your fasta file to this directory and generate replicas by running: 

conda activate idpconfgen 

./create_replicas.sh (Choose the number of your fasta file) 

 

Copy the folders Unst_prot, MD_parameter_files, simulation_scripts and the environment file env.yml to your project scratch in Mahti.  Can also be run in Lumi but requires some modifications. 

 

Mahti 

To copy to Mahti, run command (using my paths as example): 

 

scp -r Unst_prot MD_parameter_files simulation_scripts env.yml malmcajs@mahti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_***/cmcajsa/MD-stabilization/structures/forcefield_compare 

Log into Mahti: 

ssh malmcajs@mahti.csc.fi 

Go to folder: 

/scratch/project_***/cmcajsa/MD-stabilization/structures/forcefield_compare/simulation_scripts/run_dir 

 

 

Run scripts in order: 

sh run_prep.sh 

sh run_batch_md.sh 

sh run_analysis.sh 

Before you run the next script, you must ensure the previous step was finished. E.g., you can check if the system preparation run was successful by going to /scratch/project_2003809/cmcajsa/MD-stabilization/structures/forcefield_compare/Unst_prot and running ls -lh */*/md*tpr. Run ls -lh */*/md*tpr | wc â€“l to count the files. The last script collects the results, which can be found in /scratch/project_***/cmcajsa/MD-stabilization/structures/forcefield_compare/results.
