Semi-automatic MD production and comparison to NMR relaxation times
(Download and extract Automation_tool_scripts_LUMI recipitory) 


The first step is to generate the initial replicas. Go to https://idpconformergenerator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html or follow the installation steps below: 
 
cd Automation_tool_scripts_*/Idpconfgenerator_automation
git clone https://github.com/julie-forman-kay-lab/IDPConformerGenerator 
cd IDPConformerGenerator 
conda env create -f requirements.yml 
cd ..


Copy your fasta file to Automation_tool_scripts_LUMI directory and generate replicas by running: 

conda activate idpconfgen 
./create_replicas.sh (Choose the number of your fasta file) 


Copy Unst_prot, MD_parameter_files, simulation_scripts and env.yml to your project scratch in LUMI. Using my LUMI paths as example:

scp -r Unst_prot MD_parameter_files simulation_scripts env.yml malmcajs@lumi.csc.fi:/scratch/project_462000285/cmcajsa/systems/forcefield_compare 


Log into Lumi: 
ssh malmcajs@lumi.csc.fi 


Go to folder: 
cd /scratch/project_462000285/cmcajsa/systems/forcefield_compare


Set up the environment:
 
module purge
module load LUMI
module load lumi-container-wrapper
mkdir env
conda-containerize new --prefix env env.yml

You need to manually add your project number to the scripts. Go to simulation_scripts/MD_scripts:

Change line #SBATCH --account=project in files md_prep.sh, md.sh and analysis.sh

Add your experimental data to this folder. Make sure to add the first line with the magnetic field strength in MHz. Any missing data should type "n". Name the file exp_data.txt or go to Automation_tool_scripts_LUMI/simulation_scripts/PY_scripts/plot_replicas_to_experiment.py and change the line exp_data='/scratch/project_462000285/cmcajsa/systems/forcefield_compare/simulation_scripts/MD_scripts/exp_data.txt' to the name of your experimental data file.

An example of what it should look like can be seen in the file alpha_exp_data.txt.

Go to simulation_scripts/run_dir and run scripts in order:

sh run_prep.sh 
sh run_batch_md.sh 
sh run_analysis.sh 


Before you run the next script, you must ensure the previous step was finished. E.g., you can check if the system preparation run was successful by going to /scratch/project_462000285/cmcajsa/systems/forcefield_compare/Unst_prot and running ls -lh */*/md*tpr. Run ls -lh */*/md*tpr | wc –l to count the files. The last script collects the results, which can be found in /scratch/project_462000285/cmcajsa/systems/forcefield_compare/results
