IDPConformerGenerator is a structural homology tool that generates diverse conformers from any sequence using dihedral angle information from short sequences in culled lists. (You can choose other culled lists by going to http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/lab/pisces). 


Below are instructions to help you generate five completely disordered initial conformers:

🔹️Create/Download FASTA file and move it to the folder (Idpconfgenerator_automation).

▶️Set up the Idpconfgenerator tool:
Open terminal:
git clone https://github.com/julie-forman-kay-lab/IDPConformerGenerator 
mkdir IDPConformerGenerator
cd IDPConformerGenerator 
conda env create -f requirements.yml 
cd ..

▶️Activate conda environment:
conda activate idpconfgen

▶️Run automated replica generator script:
./create_replicas.sh


🔹️Select your FASTA file by typing in the number related to that file


The script will generete 5 different pdb files for you and move 
them into the folder Unst_prot.
