Semi-automatic MD production and comparison to NMR relaxation times
(Download and extract Automation_tool_scripts_MAHTI recipitory) 


The first step is to generate the initial replicas. Go to https://idpconformergenerator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html or follow the installation steps below: 
 
cd Automation_tool_scripts_MAHTI/Idpconfgenerator_automation
git clone https://github.com/julie-forman-kay-lab/IDPConformerGenerator 
cd IDPConformerGenerator 
conda env create -f requirements.yml 
cd ..


Copy your fasta file to Automation_tool_scripts_MAHTI directory and generate replicas by running: 

conda activate idpconfgen 
./create_replicas.sh (Choose the number of your fasta file) 


Copy Unst_prot, MD_parameter_files, simulation_scripts and env.yml to your project scratch in Mahti. Using my Mahti paths as example:

scp -r Unst_prot MD_parameter_files simulation_scripts env.yml malmcajs@mahti.csc.fi:/scratch/project_2003809/cmcajsa/MD-stabilization/structures/forcefield_compare 


Log into Mahti: 
ssh malmcajs@mahti.csc.fi 


Go to folder where you added your simulation folders/scripts: 
cd /scratch/project_2003809/cmcajsa/MD-stabilization/structures/forcefield_compare

Add your experimental data to this folder. Make sure to add the first line with the magnetic field strength in MHz. Any missing data should type "n". Name the file Unst_prot_exp_data.txt 

An example of what it should look like can be seen in the file Unst_hydrolase_exp_data.txt.

Set up the environment:
 
module purge
module load tykky
mkdir env
conda-containerize new --prefix env env.yml


Go to simulation_scripts/run_dir and run scripts in order:

sh run_prep.sh 
sh run_batch_md.sh 
sh run_analysis.sh 

Each of these scripts will ask which of your available project resources you want to use. Choose the number of the correct project.


Before you run the next script, you must ensure the previous step was finished. E.g., you can check if the system preparation run was successful by going to /scratch/project_2003809/cmcajsa/MD-stabilization/structures/forcefield_compare/Unst_prot and running ls -lh */*/md*tpr. Run ls -lh */*/md*tpr | wc –l to count the files. The last script collects the results, which can be found in /scratch/project_2003809/cmcajsa/MD-stabilization/structures/forcefield_compare/results
