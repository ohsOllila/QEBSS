Semi-automatic MD production and comparison to NMR relaxation times
(Download and extract Automation_tool_scripts_MAHTI recipitory) 


The first step is to generate the initial replicas. Go to https://idpconformergenerator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html or follow the installation steps below: 
 
cd Automation_tool_scripts_MAHTI/IDPConformerGenerator
git clone https://github.com/julie-forman-kay-lab/IDPConformerGenerator 
cd IDPConformerGenerator 
conda env create -f requirements.yml 
cd ..


Copy your fasta file to Automation_tool_scripts_MAHTI/IDPConformerGenerator directory and generate replicas by running: 

conda activate idpconfgen 
./create_replicas.sh (Choose the number of your fasta file) 


Copy Unst_prot, MD_parameter_files, simulation_scripts and env.yml to your project scratch in MAHTI. 


Add your experimental data to the same folder. Make sure to add the first line with the magnetic field strength in MHz. Any missing data should type "n". 
Name the file Unst_prot_exp_data.txt

An example of what it should look like can be seen in the file Unst_alphasynuclein_exp_data.txt

You can also copy relaxation times T1, T2 and hetNOE from https://bmrb.io/ and run `create_exp.py` to automatically create the file. OBS! Copy only the data, skipping the initial text.


Set up the environment:
 
module purge
module load tykky
mkdir env
conda-containerize new --prefix env env.yml

Go to simulation_scripts/run_dir and run scripts in order:

sh run_prep.sh 
sh run_batch_md.sh 
sh run_analysis.sh 


Before you run the next script, you must ensure the previous step was finished.
